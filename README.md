# Hi there! I'm Rick Egdorf.
Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## Who am I?

**Business Analyst | Business Liason | Sr. Technical Writer | Process Improvement Analyst | Knowledge Analyst**

I'm an energetic, focused, innovator who loves a challenge, including those that require new skills. Most recently, my role was that but also required me to step up into roles that needed attention. Originally hired to create a data dictionary, opportunities arose for user acceptance testing (UAT) curator, business liaison, project lead, data validation, and Power BI report developer. I communicate equally well with business, technology, and leadership.
